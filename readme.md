## About The Project
This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. There's a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu, but the focus is HTML & CSS.
The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

<br><br>Users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
<br>

<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- JavaScript

## What I learned
Great project if you are just starting out or need to remember the basics like class toggle for hamburger menu.
